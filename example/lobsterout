WARNING: You are using a fully symmetrized k-point grid. If you don't know what that means
WARNING: stop here and check the manual. Please Prepare a k-point grid that spans EITHER the whole
WARNING: Brillouin zone (i.e. without symmetry) or half of the Brillouin zone 
WARNING: (i.e. only time reversal symmetry) and restart your quantum-mechanical calculation

INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 181 and upwards will be ignored.
setting up CO interactions... found 108 interactions.
projecting...
WARNING: Cannot use the tetrahedron method for k-space integration and must fall
WARNING: back to Gaussian smearing which can take significantly longer. Make
WARNING: sure to use the tetrahedron method whenever applicable.

post-processing projection...
WARNING: 31 of 34 k-points could not be orthonormalized with an accuracy of 1.0E-5.
WARNING: Generally, this is not a critical error. But to help you analyze it,
WARNING: I dumped the band overlap matrices to the file bandOverlaps.lobster.
WARNING: Please check how much they deviate from the identity matrix and decide to
WARNING: use your results only, if you are sure that this is ok.
